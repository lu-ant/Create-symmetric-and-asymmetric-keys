 Google Cloud Key Management Lab

Overview

In this lab, we explored cryptographic key management in Google Cloud by creating both symmetric and asymmetric encryption keys. These keys are essential for securing data at rest, in transit, and during processing.

🏦 Scenario: Securing Cymbal Bank's Data
Cymbal Bank, handling sensitive financial transactions and Personally Identifiable Information (PII), aims to securely transfer its data to the cloud. To achieve this, we used Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) to:
✅ Generate a symmetric key for bulk encryption/decryption
✅ Generate an asymmetric key for secure key exchange and digital signatures


🚀 Steps Completed
1️⃣ Creating a Symmetric Key
Navigated to Security > Key Management in Google Cloud
Created a Key Ring (demo-key-ring)
Generated a Symmetric Key (demo-key)
Configured:
Protection Level: Software
Purpose: Encrypt/Decrypt
Key Rotation Period: 90 days
🔹 Use Case: Symmetric encryption is fast and efficient, making it ideal for encrypting large datasets before transmission.


2️⃣ Creating an Asymmetric Key
Created an Asymmetric Key (demo-asymmetric-key) under the same key ring
Configured:
Protection Level: Software
Purpose: Asymmetric Decrypt
Algorithm: Default asymmetric settings
🔹 Use Case: Asymmetric cryptography enables secure key exchange and digital signatures, ensuring data authenticity and integrity.


🎯 Key Takeaways
✔ Symmetric keys are ideal for bulk encryption but require a secure method of key distribution
✔ Asymmetric keys enable secure key exchange and authentication but are computationally expensive
✔ Google Cloud KMS simplifies key management, improving security and compliance


✅ Conclusion
This lab provided hands-on experience with Google Cloud's encryption capabilities. By leveraging symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, we can enhance data security in cloud environments.


🔐 Security First! Encryption is key to protecting sensitive data.
